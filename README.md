# Lake Vernon Yacht Club (LVYC)

Welcome to the Lake Vernon Yacht Club demo website! This is a fictional yacht club project built with Ruby on Rails. It serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my skills in web development and Ruby on Rails. While this is a demo project, it can also be used by anyone who wants to showcase a basic yacht club website.

Lake Vernon is a lake I grew up on in Muskoka, Ontario that _currently_ doesn't have

## Features
